# Install Dependencies on Different Platforms

In a nutshell, you need the following libraries:
+ libjpeg, libpng headers
+ opengl & egl headers
+ a recent version of glfw3 and glm headers
+ x11 headers
+ python headers
+ libglvnd (needed on certain systems)

The way to install these dependencies is different on various platforms.
For people not familiar enough with Linux, they are not easy to install manually.
That's why we recommend using docker to avoid the build process.

These are some platforms we've tested on:

### Ubuntu 16.04
```
apt install libglfw3-dev libglm-dev libx11-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev
```

Install libglvnd (sometimes not necessary, but will be needed to resolve conflicts
if multiple opengl libraries exist on your system):
```bash
cd SOME/DOWNLOAD_DIR/
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/libglvnd && cd libglvnd
./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=SOME/INSTALL_DIR --disable-egl
# disable-egl is needed, to use libEGL that comes with the driver, but everything else from libglvnd
make && make install
# add INSTALL_DIR/lib/pkgconfig to PKG_CONFIG_PATH
# add INSTALL_DIR/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

### macOS
```bash
brew install glfw glm jpeg libpng pkg-config
# If you've installed findutils without this option, uninstall it first.
brew install findutils --with-default-names
# add /usr/local/bin to PATH
```

### ArchLinux
```bash
pacman -S glfw-x11 libglvnd glm libjpeg-turbo libpng mesa
```

### CentOS 7 with Nvidia GPU
```bash
yum install libX11-devel glfw-devel glm-devel mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libEGL-devel libpng-devel libjpeg-devel autoconf automake libtool
```

Install libglvnd the same way as above.

### Ubuntu 14.04 with Nvidia GPU
```bash
apt install libx11-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev
```

Install glfw3 (the one in apt is too old):
```bash
cd SOME/DOWNLOAD_DIR
wget https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases/download/3.2.1/glfw-3.2.1.zip
unzip glfw-3.2.1.zip && cd glfw-3.2.1
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=SOME/INSTALL_DIR -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
make && make install
# add INSTALL_DIR/lib/pkgconfig to PKG_CONFIG_PATH
# add INSTALL_DIR/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Install glm (the one in apt is too old):
```bash
cd SOME/DOWNLOAD_DIR
wget https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases/download/0.9.8.4/glm-0.9.8.4.zip
unzip glm-0.9.8.4 && cd glm
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=SOME/INSTALL_DIR
make && make install
```
Later, remember to compile the renderer with `INCLUDE_DIR=-I/path/to/INSTALL_DIR/include make`.

Install EGL headers (the headers in apt is too old):
```
cd SOME/INSTALL_DIR
wget -P EGL https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/api/EGL/egl.h
wget -P EGL https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/api/EGL/eglext.h
wget -P EGL https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/api/EGL/eglplatform.h
```
Later, remember to compile `INCLUDE_DIR=-I/path/to/INSTALL_DIR make`.

If multiple `INCLUDE_DIR` need to be added, use `INCLUDE_DIR="-I/path/one -I/path/two"`.

Install libglvnd the same way as above.
